# Handling Imbalanced Datasets with Machine Learning

Welcome to this repository, where we explore powerful algorithms designed to tackle the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets in machine learning. 
Our aim is to enhance the performance of machine learning models when dealing with datasets that exhibit class imbalance.

## What Was Explored:

In this repository, we've delved into the application of several prominent algorithms, including:
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):** Used to synthetically generate minority class samples.
- **ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling):** Employed to adaptively balance class distributions.
- **NearMiss:** Utilized to select relevant instances for imbalanced datasets.
- **Condensed Nearest Neighbors:** Applied for dimensionality reduction while preserving data integrity.

## Business Cases:

Our exploration extends to real-world business scenarios, including:
- **Loan Classification:** Addressing class imbalance.
- **Fraud Detection:** Enhancing fraud detection models for better risk management.
- **Churn Prediction:** Improving customer retention by identifying potential churners.

We invite you to explore our work, contribute, and leverage these techniques to enhance your machine-learning projects.
